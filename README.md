Thank you very much for this opportunity! I really enjoyed this project, especially getting practice with Pycro-Manager's
Acquisition engine which I haven't explored very much. I hope to hear back from you soon!

Structure:

For Problem 1, there are three coding solutions:
  - problem_1_mda
  - problem_1_pycro
  - problem_1_script

  An output from each script can be found at the following link:

For Problem 2, the code can be found in problem_2.py and the output is located in problem_2_output.

Finally, for Problem 3, the code can be found in problem_3.py, some test functions can be found in problem_3_test.py,
and the output can be found in problem_3_output.
